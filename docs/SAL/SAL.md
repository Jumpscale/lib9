# System Abstraction Layers (SALs)

A System Abstraction Layer (SAL) is a thin abstraction layer making it easy for developers to interact with a system component locally or (partly) remotely.

As part of JumpScale 8 following SALs are included:

- [DiskLayout](Disklayout.md)
- [FS](FS.md)
- [KVM](KVM.md)
- [Open vSwitch](OpenVSwitch.md)
- [Samba](Samba.md)
- [SSHD](SSHD.md)
- [Tmux](Tmux.md)
- [Ubuntu](Ubuntu.md)
- [UFW](UFW.md)

There are many more SALs, for Windows, Unix, SSL, SSL Signing, TLS, NGINX and QEMU images.

The full list of all SALs can be found in the [JumpScale API](../JumpscaleAPI/SUMMARY.md) section.
