# Cuisine module

Here is an example prefab module. Read the comments to see what is expected in the module.

```python
from js9 import j
from JumpScale9Lib.tools.prefab.CuisineFactory import CuisineApp


class CuisineExample(CuisineApp):

    """
    always define the name of you module, it's used in
    the self.isInstalled method to check if your app is already present on the system
    """
    NAME = 'example'

    def _init(self):
        # if the module builds something, define BUILDDIR and CODEDIR folders.
        self.BUILDDIR = self.core.replace("$BUILDDIR/example/")
        self.CODEDIR = self.core.replace("$CODEDIR/github/example/myapp")

    def reset(self):
        """
        helper method to clean what this module generates.

        Make sure your build supports all supported architecture. (linux, OSX, ...)

        if your app requires some dependencies, you can if the dependency is installed or not and try to installed it from here.
